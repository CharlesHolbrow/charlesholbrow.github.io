				<p>The world wide web was conceived 30 years ago. What will internet media look like after another 30 years? Should we expect it to be mostly the same? Or will
					it evolve rapidly in the coming years?</p>
				<p>To understand these questions, I have been studying the evolution of other media technologies. In the process I am working to identifying ways that they are
					both similar to, and different from the internet.</p>
				<p><strong><a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~holbrow/timelines/">Media Timelines</a></strong> packages this research in an interactive application that makes
					it easy to visualize the evolution of sound recording, film, internet, and other media technologies.</p>

				</p>
				<p>By employing a <strong>contextual zoom</strong> interface, Media Timelines makes it possible to effortlessly zoom from a high level historical overview of 20th
					century music and technology, to a detailed timeline showing the exact day that a music album was released. The interface exposes a growing database of information,
					details, and historical anecdotes on art, music, media, and history.</p>
				<p>This technique for interacting with historical media content led to some surprising conclusions about the current state of internet media, and some interesting
					hypotheses about the future, both of which will form the foundation for my PhD dissertation.</p>
