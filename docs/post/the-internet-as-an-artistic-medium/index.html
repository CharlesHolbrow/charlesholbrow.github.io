			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Art does more than just communicate a message or opinion. It can open our mind to a new understanding of ourself or of the world around us. If we look at media
					like music, film or literature, each has examples that are widely accepted as great works of art.</p>
				<p>Is there great art that uses the Web as a medium? We can find video or music on the web that might satisfy our notion of great art, but most of these merely
					use the internet as a means of propagation. Is <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> art? What about <strong>Google.com</strong>, <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>The Silk Road</strong>,
					and <strong>Pokemon Go</strong>?</p>
				<p>Today the internet is commonly thought of as source of news and entertainment, a tool for communication, and a platform for political propaganda. Film and sound
					recording were also used for these purposes before they evolved into the rich media we are familiar with today.</p>
				<p>Does the future of content on the internet include powerful artistic experiences? What are the key features of the internet that set it apart from other forms
					of digital media.</p>
				<p>as content on the internet moves out of our screens and into the world around us through augmented/virtual reality and connected devices?</p>
				<p>In particular, the evolution of both film and sound recording followed a trajectory that has notable similarities with the evolution of the internet.</p>

				</ul>
				<h2 id="the-pattern">The Pattern</h2>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>
						<p>A technology for communication is developed. The new technology enables existing art or media to reach a wider audience.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The technology is marketed to and consumed by the public. It achieves some commercial success and is culturally accepted as a means of communication and entertainment.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The technology is adopted for military purposes such as disseminating propaganda. International conflict stimulates government investment and advances the
							state of the technology. Governments are not limited by the same restrictions as commercial institutions, and are free to innovate new applications that may
							not be commercially feasible.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Artists reclaim the technology and discover a creative vocabulary unique to the medium. The technical advancements evolve into a fundamentally new form of
							artistic expression.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Today, content on the web is measured by the number of users it attracts and the amount of money that changes hands as a result. But could the internet follow
					the pattern described I have described? It seems not unlikely. &lt;history of the internet&gt;.</p>
				<p>A government may invest in technology to accomplish a political or military objective, but historically, the advanced technology ultimately finds its way into
					the hands of artists who use it to communicate a counter point to the government&#x2019;s propaganda. My goal is to hasten the adoption of the internet as a
					tool for activism and politically motivated art.</p>
				<p>You may have noticed I did not answer the original question. Is there art on the internet? This is a distinctly unhelpful question.</p>
				<p>Note: Governments producing propaganda are not interested in making a profit. They want to send a message, and they want to do it as cheaply and efficiently
					as possible. From this perspective, the goals of the government are similar to the goals of artists. It could be that the parallel is why techniques by governments
					for propaganda also become valuable to artists.</p>
