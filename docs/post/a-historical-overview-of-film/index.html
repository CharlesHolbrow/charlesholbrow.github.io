				<p><strong>Note: What follows is a draft. It is factual, but incomplete and in need of editing.</strong></p>
				<p>In the early 1890s, films were seen as novelty. The early technology limited the length of a film to under one minute. Films were in black and white, had no
					sound, and no narrative cinematic technique. Over the next 65 years, film evolved into the cinematic storytelling media that we are familiar with today.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>1890s - The first films are novelties, less than a minute long, and mostly lacking any narrative.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1896 - Alice Guy creates La Fe&#x301;e aux Choux (The Cabbage Fairy). Guy is likely the first filmmaker to add narrative to film.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1902 - A Trip to the Moon - A short silent science fiction film, complete with special effects. Film makers at this time are using narrative and basic editing
							techniques.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1906 - The Story of the Kelly Gang - The first dramatic feature length film. Approximately 60 minutes long.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1910s - Newsreels become a popular way for the public to learn about current events</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1914 - World War I begins on July 28th</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1915 - Technicolor is founded. Creating colorful films is technically difficult, and does not widely used in films until the 1930s and 1940s <a href="https://the-artifice.com/history-of-colour-film/">source</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1915 - The Birth of a Nation - One of the first (silent) fictional feature length films is racist propaganda used as a recruitment tool for the KKK. It is
							unprecedented in budget and production values. Directed and co-produced by D. W. Griffith.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1915 - France creates the Cin&#xE9;matographique de l&#x2019;Arm&#xE9;e</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1916 - Germany bans most foreign films (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_film_propaganda#Germany">source</a>).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1916 - Britain creates the War Office Cinematograph Committee (WOCC). Britain had many different departments creating propaganda, for example Wellington House,
							but not all produced film propaganda (<a href="https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/propaganda_at_home_great_britain_and_ireland">source</a>).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1917 - Germany&#x2019;s Supreme Army Command creates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFA_GmbH#Establishment">UFA</a>, a particularly strategic and
							effective propaganda film production company. Germany also creates the Bild und Filmamt (<a href="%5Bhttps://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/bild-_und_filmamt_bufa">BUFA</a>).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1917 - The United States Committee on Public Information creates the Division of Films, starting the U.S. film propaganda initiative</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1917 - Soviet Russia establishes the Film Subdepartment of the People&#x2019;s Commissariat of Education</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1917 - US, Britain, France, Germany and Soviet Russia all have propaganda departments. However, it was very difficult to capture actual war footage, so most
							of the supposed war footage released to the public was staged (According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxgpEUL23AY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=192">this video</a>							less than 10% was real).</p>
					</li>
					<li>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1935 - Triumph of the Will - Created by Leni Riefenstahl, this Nazi film is considered the most effective propaganda video ever made. It was highly technically
							innovative and featured aerial photography, moving cameras, and pioneering use of cinematic music. It includes this quote attributed to Dietrich: (Translated
							from German) &#x201C;<em>Truth is the foundation on which the power of the press stands and falls. Reporting the truth about Germany is our only demand of the press, including the foreign press.</em>&#x201D;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1939 - September 1st. WW2 Begins</p>
					</li>
					<li>

							Takes Over&#x201D; by Universal.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1945 - September 2nd. WW2 Ends</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1954 - Seven Samurai - Feature length film that pioneered multi-camera techniques, including cutting between shots from different angles, putting the audience
							in the middle of the action.</p>
					</li>
