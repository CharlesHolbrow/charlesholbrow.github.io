				<p><strong>Note: What follows is a draft. It is factual, but incomplete and in need of editing.</strong></p>
				<h2 id="sound-recording">Sound Recording</h2>
				<p>In 1877, Thomas Edison built and patented the first device that can both record and reproduce sound. The storage medium is a grooved cylinder wrapped in a layer
					of thick tinfoil (p9). Edison and others tried to commercialize the device (ch2) and experienced some limited positive results, but many failures. Note (Charles
					Cross &#x201C;Invented&#x201D; it earlier that year, but no working device was ever found)</p>
				<p>Around the turn of the century, coin operated devices in phonograph parlors were somewhat successful, but the sound quality of these devices was still very low,
					and as the novelty of the experience wore off, the popularity of the parlors also declined.</p>
				<p>Innovations in both sound recording and reproduction continue to improve sound playback quality.</p>
				<p>The cylinder gives way to the disc as the most prominent distribution format for music. And sales of records continue to rise. In the 1910s, recorded music becomes
					a lucrative and successful market.</p>
				<p>Suddenly in 1920 record sales plummet. The Record industry crash coincides with the arrival of radio. (p64)</p>
				<p>In the 1920s AT&amp;T&#x2019;s research lab improves existing tube amplifier designs. AT&amp;T designs an electronic phonograph recorder, and licensed it to
					recording studios. AT&amp;T also design a &#x201C;scientific&#x201D; record player, and marketed it to consumers. The new electronic equipment replaced and
					dramatically improved the existing technology. Up until this point, microphones had been used in radio, but to make a recording, performers would sing into
					a horn, and depend on mechanical transduction to literally &#x2018;cut&#x2019; the record. With the advent of amplifiers, existing radio technology like the
					mixing console could be used for recording. (p65-66)</p>
				<p>In 1926, movie theaters began to install synchronized sound playback equipment. The first systems used record players synchronized with film projectors, but
					this method would soon be replaced by optical sound transcriptions printed directly on the film reel. (p76)</p>
				<p>The 1930s were marked by the great depression. Record sales would increase again in the mid 1930s (p67), but the recording industry was struggling. The film
					industry was more profitable, and both industries benefit from continuous incremental improvements to electronic sound recording technology.</p>
				<p>In the early 1940s, state of the art recording technology finally did allow engineers to make quality recordings that could capture and reproduce a musical performance
					with reasonable accuracy. Before World War Two, music recording studios would cut a full performance directly to a phonograph disc. Overdubbing and editing
					was still impractical.</p>
				<p>The phonograph recorders used in the 1940s were not portable, which led the U.S. Army Signal Corps supported the development of a portable magnetic recorder
					that used steel wire for the storage medium. Journalists could carry the device into a war zone, and later reproduce the sounds as part of a radio broadcast.</p>
				<p>While magnetic recording had been invented much earlier, it had been a commercial failure. Unbeknownst to the Allied forces, Germany had invested heavily in
					the development of magnetic recording, and had technology that was much more advanced than anything available to the Allies. In 1943, Nazi radio networks were
					continuously broadcasting high quality music and propaganda. The Allies who were monitoring the Nazi radio knew that the Germans could reproduce quality audio
					in segments of up to 15 minutes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Mullin">source</a>). This was much longer than the Allies could record. The technology
					was kept a secret until Germany fell to the Allies near the end of the war, and the Allies systematically plundered Axis technologies.</p>
				<p>Magnetic tape technology extracted from Germany after the war was not protected by patents or trade secrets, and tape quickly made its way into recording studios
					in the United States, England, France, and Soviet Russia. Initially, tape did not sound better than phonograph discs, but it quickly became cheaper to operate.
					By the end of the 1940s, recording to tape was common in music, film, and radio broadcast studios.</p>
				<p>Recording to tape was not just a cheaper replacement for disc recording. It was also flexible in ways that disc recording was not. Tape was very easy to edit.
					To make an edit, the recording engineer could simply cut the tape and then paste it together again. Tape has other advantages too. The width of magnetic tape
					allows more than one audio signal to be recorded to a single tape reel in parallel. The parallel tracks do not need to be recorded simultaneously. If a performance
					was not perfect, a single musician could re-record just a phrase or chorus and replace a small mistake. For the first time, a recording could actually sound
					better than a live performance. The introduction of multitrack tape machines in recording studios unlocked a host of new possibilities for recording musical
					performance, and set the stage for music recording to become a form of art itself.</p>
				<p>The introduction of tape machines in recording studios preceded an explosion of creativity, exploration, and acclaim in recorded music of all kinds. I&#x2019;ll
					post a more detailed look at the 1950s and 1960s in part 2.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>1947 According to <a href="https://theaudiophileman.com/bing-crosby-tape-revolution/">this site</a>, October 1, 1947 was the first broadcast of a radio program
							recorded to tape was Bing Cosby (October 1, 1947). However, this is not correct, because the Nazis were broadcasting from tape back in WWII.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1948 Pierre Schaeffer coined the term musique concr&#xE8;te. This is also the year he created &#x201C;Cinq &#xE9;tudes de bruits&#x201D; &#x201C;Five studies
							of noises&#x201D; (tape music)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1949 - The tape splicing block is introduced.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1951 - How High the Moon - Les Paul and Mary Ford pioneering use of overdubs leads this song to spend 25 weeks on the billboards charts with 9 weeks as #1.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1955 - Maybellene - Chuck Berry&#x2019;s first single, and his first hit. The birth of Rock and Roll.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1955 - Gesang der J&#xFC;nglinge - Regarded as the first masterpiece of electronic composition.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1960 - Money (That&#x2019;s What I Want) - Motown&#x2019;s first hit (of many)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1965 - Pet Sounds</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>1967 - (recorded 66-67) - Sgt Pepper&#x2019;s Lonely Hearts Club Band - Lots of firsts: use of DI, extensive pitch control using varispeed, elaborate bouncing
							between four-track tapes, a process called ADT, aka artificial double-tracking, close-miking the drums and more (<a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/inside-track-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band">source</a>).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the 20 years following World War Two, sound recording blossomed a new medium with its own creative vocabulary. Notice that while Pet Sounds and Sargent Pepper&#x2019;s
					are considered the first pop albums to really use the studio as an instrument, artists like Pierre Schaeffer and Karlheinz Stockhausen had already been doing
					this a decade before.</p>
