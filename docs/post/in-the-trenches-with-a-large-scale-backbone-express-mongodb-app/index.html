			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I&#x2019;ve just finished some contract work on the Web App <a href="http://www.visualstager.com">www.VisualStager.com</a>. This is a large scale project that
					build on top of Express, Mongoose, Backbone, <a href="http://lazd.github.io/F/">F</a>, and <a href="http://lazd.github.io/PseudoClass/">PsuedoClass</a>.</p>
				<p>Since Express and Backbone are both lightweight and flexible, it was pretty neat to see them working a part of a well designed large scale production app. My
					team of four developers had just under two weeks to build out an admin interface for the entire app.</p>
				<p>Visual Stager is an interior design app that depends on three.js and clever mathematics to position 3D furniture models inside a 2D photo of a room. We needed
					to create admin pages for the Account, User, House, Photo, Scene, and Furniture collections. While the experience is still fresh in my mind, I&#x2019;m going
					to memoize some interesting takeaways.</p>
				<h2 id="pure-backbone-is-too-lightweight-for-large-scale-apps">Pure Backbone is too lightweight for large scale apps</h2>
				<p>In a mature framework like Rails or Django, building an admin page is trivial. In our case, we depended on <a href="http://lazd.github.io/F/F/jsdoc/F.ListComponent.html">F.ListComponent</a>					to render collections of items as tables or lists without boilerplate. F.Component organizes the following into a logical unit of application code:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A Backbone View</li>
					<li>A Backbone Model</li>
					<li>Handlebars templates</li>
					<li>Public methods</li>
					<li>Sub-components</li>
				</ul>
				<p>F Components address one of the main complexity headaches found in backbone apps &#x2013; There is no Controller class. Additionally, we can subclass F Components
					using the <a href="http://lazd.github.io/PseudoClass/">PsuedoClass</a> inheritance pattern.</p>
				<h2 id="no-associations">No Associations</h2>
				<p>In ActiveRecord we have &#x201C;associations&#x201D;. Imagine a User in our app is a member of many accounts. When we delete the user, we want to automatically
					remove that user from all accounts it belongs to. This is trivial with ActiveRecord. However, the Mongo/Express stack is not mature enough to have abstracted
					this behavior. We had to write the association logic manually in our server-side controllers.</p>
				<h2 id="async">Async</h2>
				<p>This is where Express gets fun. As part of the admin behavior, I found myself writing backend operations that run on large collections of MongoDB documents.
					The asynchronous style of node.js lends itself perfectly to this type of operation. The <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">async</a> library provides
					operations that operate on collections, similar to _.each and _.map &#x2013; the difference between async and underscore is synchronicity. Async iterators may
					operate on each member of a collection asynchronously.</p>
