				<p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking about the internet in terms of Magic. Our phones are portals in our pockets, opening a small window into another world. I like the
					magic metaphor because it encourages me to think about the internet as a place where fantastic and wonderful things can happen. But can opening up a web browser
					inspire the same feelings as reading about fictional magic?</p>
				<p>Reality Check &#x2013; the internet isn&#x2019;t <em>real</em>. Code doesn&#x2019;t actually DO real things. For me, the excitement I felt when the <strong>The Subtle Knife</strong>					opened a portal into a parallel world was more thrilling than anything I&#x2019;ve felt on the internet. The Internet <em>can</em> do all sorts of amazing things,
					but I have come to the conclusion that the price that we pay for the internet is <em>roughly</em> equal to the benefit we get. An <strong>equelibrium</strong>					of sorts. We have a fantastic library of knowledge at our fingertips, but we waste time on Facebook and buzzfeed. We have instant communication all accross
					the world, but we end up spending more time investing in virtual relationships, and less time with friends in the real world. GPS devices can magically direct
					us to a place we&#x2019;ve never been before, but by depending on GPS we are lost without it.</p>
				<p>Actually, maybe this isn&#x2019;t so unlike fictional magic. In most fictitous magical worlds, the magic does enact a kind equelibrium. Think of <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong>					&#x2013; magic is a burden that comes with a price. In <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong>, and <strong>The Golden Compass</strong>, both trilogies are concluded
					with the forfeiture of Magic. Even in Harry Potter, Magic is a force that is equally available to good and evil.</p>
				<p>Pushing the metaphor further reveals a score of additional parallels between Magic and Technology. There is a currency that powers magic and a currency that
					powers technology. After Gandalf&#x2019;s first encounter with the Balrag he was drained to the point of exaustion. Your smartphone works the same way. We study
					magic to learn it&#x2019;s secrets. I&#x2019;m currently a student at the <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hogwarts for Hackers</a>. Our efforts to become
					more skilled magic users parallel our efforts for personal growth. We aim to harness Magic for pleasure and profit. Like the internet, <strong>The Force</strong>					from <strong>Star Wars</strong> is a great source that we tap into to manipulate and enhance our lives.</p>
				<p>There are Factions that contrast in philosophy, design and implementation. Think of the five &#x201C;Colors&#x201D; in <strong>Magic: the Gathering</strong>.
					Green is the magic of nature and fecundidty, while red is the magic of Mountains and fire. These factions can interact with varying levels of synergy and incompatibility.
					Compare these colors to (for example) the functional asycronous style of node.js and the more traditional linear models of Ruby and Python.</p>
				<p>There is one important feature of technology that is missing from magic: <em>Layers of Abstraction</em>. In web development we rely on layers of abstraction
					to build projects so capable and advanced that they may be indistinguishable from magic to and end user. This is the distinction that differntiates magic from
					technology. Magic is technology that we didn&#x2019;t invent &#x2013; just discovered. Once we understand magic, we forfeit magic &#x2013; and it becomes technology.</p>
				<p>There&#x2019;s one more important parallel between magic and technology. Alladin&#x2019;s genie couldn&#x2019;t do it, neither could Dumbledor, and Gandalf may
					have come closest of all. Magic cannot conquer death. So conclusion I&#x2019;ve come to is this: Don&#x2019;t spend your life on technology&#x2026; or magic.
					Remeber the equelibrium, and try to be a force that leverages technology for the better.</p>
